==Notes==

This application has been tested on PHP 8.4.3 and <strong>should</strong> 
work with later versions.

===Installation===

Download the archive or clone this repo to where your server software looks
for files and you should be good to go, 
as long as PHP is enabled for the directory and the permissions are right.

If you would like to access questions from an address like this:

<pre>http://example.com/qoftd</pre>

Be sure that you have the server software considers PHP files an index file
and rename the <strong>qofd.php</strong> to the appropriate name, 
such as <strong>index.php</strong>.

===Questions===

<dt style="font-weight:bold">Why create this application when there are many sites out there that provide this functionality?</dt>
<dd>
<p>I created this application because, at the time I wrote it, 
I streamed to both Twitch and YouTube and I wanted to implement a bot 
command that would display a question of the day.</p>
<p>While there are indeed sites out there that present a question of the day 
and allow users to request questions, they are presented as HTML, 
which can make it hard to feed back to bots, 
thereby creating headaches for those that multistream like me.</p>
<p>After noticing these things, I decided to make my own solution, 
which would output the question in a format that is easy for bots to grab.</p>

===Contributing===

Seeing as this application works as I intended to, 
though retrieval from outside sources needs to be checked, 
there is not much that can be done.

However, if you notice some issues 
or would like to add questions, 
feel free to fork this repository and make a pull request.

Please be aware that if there are new questions added, 
I might not accept them for any reason, 
though the questions would have to be very uncomfortable for me to 
outright reject them.

===Support===

As I am not too well experienced with PHP, 
I am not too sure how much help I can be, but if you need help, email me at the following address:

===Acknowledgements===

I want to thank whoever was responsible for posting the ice breaker questions
I found on <abbr title="January">Jan</abbr> 2025 at the address below:

https://www.mtu.edu/student-leadership/student-orgs/rso-resources/virtual-resources/icebreakers/

Many of the questions listed in this project came from there to serve as the base set of questions to draw from.
